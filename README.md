# M-S
Coding excercise for M&amp;S

If I had more time, I would:

- add UI Tests
- test the app with different connectivity levels
- figure out why images are not loading on the details screen (but I think they are just missing on the backend)
- add even more unit tests
- would be great to add caching as well
